## Examples
### 1. Using JSON file auth
```
mxr-cli upload-app /path/to/apkfile.apk --api-key-file /path/to/api_key.json
```
### 2. Using environment variable auth
```
MXR_API_KEY_ID="xxx" MXR_API_KEY_SECRET="xxx" mxr-cli upload-app /path/to/apkfile.apk
```
### 3. Using options
This example uses the following options
- `--obb-file` to upload an obb with the apk
- `--title` to set the app title in ManageXR as "Cool new app"
- `--description` to set the app description in ManageXR as  "This app is amazing"
- `--release-channel` to publish the new app version to the "Dev" release channel

and a JSON file for auth.

```
mxr-cli upload-app /path/to/apkfile.apk --obb-file  /path/to/obbfile.obb --title "Cool new app" --description "This app is amazing" --release-channel "Dev" --api-key-file /path/to/api_key.json
```

### 4. With bundled files
Upload an app with [bundled files](https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/8013220-bundle-files-with-your-app) and choose the location where the files should be installed on devices

- `--bundle-directory` uploads files stored at /path/to/directory on local machine as bundled files
- `/path/on/device` optional path to location on device where bundled files will be installed e.g., `Android/obb/com.your.app`

```
mxr-cli upload-app /path/to/apkFile.apk --bundle-directory /path/to/directory /path/on/device --api-key-file /path/to/api_key.json
