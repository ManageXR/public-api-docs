## Overview

The ManageXR CLI is a useful tool to automate the process of uploading applications to ManageXR. You can use the CLI in your CI/CD pipeline to upload new app versions to your ManageXR organization and publish versions to [release channels](https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5518816-release-channels).

## Getting Started
The `mxr-cli` is available as an NPM package or a binary executable. To get started select one of the three quick set up options below.
### Choose one of:
#### (A) Install using NPM 
Paste in your terminal to install:
``` 
npm install -g @managexr/mxr-cli
```
Then, run using `mxr-cli`:
``` 
mxr-cli <command> [options]
```

#### (B) Run using NPX
Use `npx` to directly run a CLI command _without_ an `npm install`:
``` 
npx @managexr/mxr-cli <command> [options]
``` 
#### (C) Run using binary executable
If your machine does not have `node.js`, you can use a binary instead. Download the binary for your machine:
- [Download for Linux](https://mighty-platform-prod.appspot.com/cli/download?os=linux)

- [Download for Mac](https://mighty-platform-prod.appspot.com/cli/download?os=mac)

- [Download for Windows](https://mighty-platform-prod.appspot.com/cli/download?os=win)

Then, run the binary using:
``` 
path/to/mxr-cli <command> [options]
```

<Note>
On Mac and Linux machines, you may need to grant executable permissions to the binary before you can run it. To do this, run ```chmod +x path/to/mxr-cli```.
</Note>

### Authenticate Requests

To authenticate each request, add an Authorization header with the contents:

```
Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>
```
where `<encoded-value>` is the Base64 encoding of `api_key_id:api_key_secret`. 

If you're sending requests via curl or something like axios, you won't need to encode the id:secret pair.
