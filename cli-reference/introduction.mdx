## Overview

The ManageXR CLI is a useful tool to automate the process of uploading applications to ManageXR. You can use the CLI in your CI/CD pipeline to upload new app versions to your ManageXR organization and publish versions to [release channels](https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5518816-release-channels).

## Getting Started
The `mxr-cli` is available as an NPM package or a binary executable. To get started select one of the three quick set up options below.
### Choose one of:
#### (A) Install using NPM 
Paste in your terminal to install:
``` 
npm install -g @managexr/mxr-cli
```
Then, run using `mxr-cli`:
``` 
mxr-cli <command> [options]
```

#### (B) Run using NPX
Use `npx` to directly run a CLI command _without_ an `npm install`:
``` 
npx @managexr/mxr-cli <command> [options]
``` 
#### (C) Run using a binary
If your machine does not have `node.js`, you can use a binary executable instead. Download the binary for your machine:
- [Download for Linux](https://mighty-platform-prod.appspot.com/cli/download?os=linux)

- [Download for Mac](https://mighty-platform-prod.appspot.com/cli/download?os=mac)

- [Download for Windows](https://mighty-platform-prod.appspot.com/cli/download?os=win)

Then, run the binary using:
``` 
path/to/mxr-cli <command> [options]
```

<Note>
On Mac and Linux machines, you may need to grant executable permissions to the binary before you can run it. To do this, run ```chmod +x path/to/mxr-cli```.
</Note>

### Authentication

Each command must include valid authentication. Authenticate commands using ManageXR API Keys. 
1. **Create an API Key**
2. **Choose an authentication method for your commands**

    (a) Set environment variables  for `MXR_API_KEY_ID` and `MXR_API_KEY_SECRET`, _or_
    (b) Provide a JSON file as an `--api-key-file` argument to the command

    JSON file format:
    ```
    { 
      "id": "api_key_id", 
      "secret": "api_key_secret" 
    }
    ```
