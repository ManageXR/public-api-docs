## Requirements
To work with the mxrus-sdk package, you need to design your environments in a Unity project that:
* Is on Unity 2021.3.x (recommended) or older
* Uses Universal Render Pipeline (URP) version 12.1.14

## Installation  
> ⚠️  
> We recommend installing the latest version of the SDK.  
> Version name are in the format `vx.x.x`, for example `v0.2.0`  
> [Version history can be found here](https://github.com/ManageXR/mxrus-sdk/releases)  

Go to your project manifest json file located at `Packages/manifest.json`.
Add this line to your dependency list
* `"com.mxr.mxrus.sdk":"https://www.github.com/ManageXR/mxrus-sdk.git#VERSION"` 
    * `VERSION` is the SDK version you want to install
    * For example, if you want to install version `v0.2.0`, the line should be `"com.mxr.mxrus.sdk":"https://www.github.com/ManageXR/mxrus-sdk.git#v0.2.0"`

### Changing the SDK version
If you want to move to a different SDK version (for example, when a new version is released and you want to upgrade), open `Packages/manifest.json` and change the version in the `"com.mxr.mxrus.sdk"` dependency line and refresh your Unity project.
