### Start your project
* Create (or open) a Unity project. Ensure the Unity version is _Unity 2021.3 or below_
* Import the URP `12.1.14` package
* Create a URP Asset in your Assets window using `Right Click>Create>Rendering>URP Asset (with Universal Renderer)`
* Set the URP Asset in your Graphics Settings by going to `Project Settings>Graphics>Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings`

### Create your environment
* Use the Unity workflow design your scene
* Create a GameObject and add the `MonoCircularUserAreaProvider` component to it.
    * Ensure that Gizmos are enabled in your Scene view. You should see a blue avatar with concentric circles around it.
    * The position and rotation of the avatar determine the location and direction the user will start at.
    * The walkable area shows how far they can walk. Going out of these bounds will fade out the screen.
    * Change the `Walkable Radius` value of the `MonoCircularUserAreaProvider` component. The concentric circles will update to reflect the new value. Set this value to match the area you want the user to be able to walk around in.

## Design tips
* Changing your render pipeline to URP may result in some materials turning pink if they're using shaders incompatible with URP (for example the Stardard shader used in Built-In Render Pipeline)
    * To fix this select these materials and click on `Unity toolbar>Edit>Rendering>Materials>Convert Selected Built-in Materials to URP`. Check if the material gets updated correctly, if not, resolve manually.
* Since your Unity scene will run on standalone VR headsets, ensure that the scene is optimized for mobile devices. 
    * Try to keep your triangle count low
    * Use mobile friendly shaders
    * Bake lighting as much as possible
    * Avoid particle systems with high particle count 
    * Try to keep your draw calls/batches low.
    
### Validating and exporting your scene
* Go to `Unity toolbar>MXR>Scene Exporter`. A window titled `MXR Scene Exporter` will open.
* Click on the `Validate` button. This will validate your scene and violations in your scene (if any) will be highlighted. Click on an issue to expand the GameObjects or assets that are causing it.
    * Issues shown in red will _prevent_ export unless you address them
    * Issues shown in yellow are warnings which don't prevent exporting but highlight potential compatibility or performance problems.

    * To see the full list of validation issues, see the "Limitations" section.
* If you have no export preventing issues, you'll see the `Export Scene` button that will allow you to export the file to your preferred location
