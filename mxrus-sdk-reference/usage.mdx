### Start your project
* Create (or open) a Unity project. Ensure the Unity version is _Unity 2021.3 or below_
* Import the URP `12.1.14` package
* Create a URP Asset in your Project view using `Right Click > Create > Rendering > URP Asset (with Universal Renderer)`
* Set the URP Asset in your Graphics Settings by going to `Project Settings > Graphics > Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings`

### Create your environment
* Use the Unity workflow to design your scene
* Create a GameObject and add the `MonoCircularUserAreaProvider` component to it.
    * Ensure that Gizmos are enabled in your Scene view. You should see a blue avatar with concentric circles around it.
    * The position and rotation of the avatar determine the location and direction the user will start at.
    * Change the `Walkable Radius` value of the `MonoCircularUserAreaProvider` component. The concentric circles will update to reflect the new value. Set this value to match the area you want the user to be able to walk around in.

## Design tips
* Changing your render pipeline to URP may result in some materials turning pink if they're using shaders incompatible with URP (for example the Stardard shader used in Built-In Render Pipeline)
    * To fix this select these materials and click on `Unity toolbar > Edit > Rendering > Materials > Convert Selected Built-in Materials to URP`. Check if the material gets updated correctly, if not, resolve manually.
* Since your Unity scene will run on standalone VR headsets, ensure that the scene is optimized for mobile devices. 
    * Try to keep your triangle count low
    * Use mobile friendly shaders
    * Bake lighting as much as possible
    * Avoid very complex particle systems with high particle count 
    * Try to keep your draw calls/batches low.
    
### Validating and exporting your scene
* Go to `Unity toolbar > MXR > Scene Exporter`. A window titled `MXR Scene Exporter` will open.
* Click on the `Validate` button. This will validate your scene and violations (if any) in your scene will be highlighted. Click on an issue to expand it. A brief description and any relevant GameObject or Asset will be shown.
    * Issues shown in red will _prevent_ export unless you address them
    * Issues shown in yellow are warnings which don't prevent exporting but highlight potential compatibility or performance problems.
    * To see the full list of validation issues, see the "Limitations" section.

* If you have no export preventing issues, you'll see the `Export Scene` button that will allow you to export the file to your preferred location

### Post Export
After your `mxrus` file is finished building and has exported, you'll see a build report that will show the different assets that have been packaged.

Clicking on these assets will highlight them in your Project view so that you can easily locate them.

Using the asset type dropdown you can go through different assets such as shaders, textures, meshes and more.

This build report can be used to identify large assets that can be optimized or simply removed from the scene to reduce the export size.
  
The ManageXR web console has a size limit on how large mxrus files you can upload. See the Advanced section for tips of reducing export size.
