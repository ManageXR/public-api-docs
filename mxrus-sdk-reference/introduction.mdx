The mxrus-sdk repository is available [on GitHub here](https://github.com/ManageXR/mxrus-sdk/tree/main)

MXRUS (ManageXR Unity Scene) files with the `.mxrus` extension allow you to export Unity scenes and supporting metadata for deploying to your ManageXR enrolled device. Using this package you can easily export your Unity scene with just a few clicks. 

If you're creating your own custom homescreen application, it also allows you to load `.mxrus` files at runtime and display them at runtime.

## Features
This SDK allows you to export Unity scenes as `mxrus` files which provides some great benefits during your environment design process:
* A well understood Unity workflow for prototyping and composing your 3D scenes
* Realtime and baked lighting 
* Unity Terrain System, Particle Systems, UI Canvas, TextMeshPro and Animation
* Custom shaders
* Embedding audio in your scene using AudioSource
* Access to a vast catalog of the third party assets from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)
* Profiling tools to optimize your environment

If you're making a custom homescreen, the `SceneLoader` class provides an easy to use API that automatically handles extraction and loading of the file at runtime. 
  
The environment can then be instantiated in your homescreen as a Unity Scene which makes it available to you in the scene hierarchy and Unity APIs can be used to further drive behaviour.
  
For more information on loading an mxrus file at runtime inside your Unity app, see the "Advanced" section.
