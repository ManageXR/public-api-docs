The mxrus-sdk repository is available [on GitHub here](https://github.com/ManageXR/mxrus-sdk/tree/main)

This package provides you the tools to export Unity scenes, required assets and relevant metadata into MXRUS (ManageXR Unity Scene) files with the `.mxrus` extension. 
These files can then be remotely deployed to your ManageXR enrolled device. 

## Features
Being Unity Editor based, building your environment in the mxrus format has some great benefits:
* Use a widely understood and adopted Unity workflow for creating your 3D scenes
* Support for a wide range of Unity features. This includes but is not limited to:
    * Baked and realtime lighting
    * Terrain tools
    * Particle systems
    * UI and TextMeshPro
    * Animation tools 
    * Custom shaders
    * Environment audio using AudioSource
    * Profiling tools to optimize your environment
* Access to a vast catalog of the third party assets from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)

If you're making a custom homescreen, the `SceneLoader` class provides an easy to use API that automatically handles extraction and loading of the file at runtime. 
  
The environment can then be loaded in your application as a Unity Scene which makes it available in the scene hierarchy and Unity APIs can be used to further drive behaviour.
  
For more information on loading an mxrus file at runtime inside your Unity app, see the "Advanced" section.
