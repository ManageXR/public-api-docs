The mxrus-sdk repository is available [on GitHub here](https://github.com/ManageXR/mxrus-sdk/tree/main)

This package provides you the tools to export Unity scenes, required assets and relevant metadata into MXRUS (ManageXR Unity Scene) files with the `.mxrus` extension. 
These files can then be remotely deployed to your ManageXR enrolled device. 

## Features
Being Unity Editor based, building your environment in the mxrus format has some great benefits:
* Use a widely understood and adopted Unity workflow for creating your 3D scenes
* Support for a wide range of Unity features. This includes but is not limited to:
    * Baked and realtime lighting
    * Terrain tools
    * Particle systems
    * UI and TextMeshPro
    * Animation tools 
    * Custom shaders
    * Environment audio using AudioSource
    * Profiling tools to optimize your environment
* Access to a vast catalog of the third party assets from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)

If you're also building custom launcher menus with our Unity SDK, the `SceneLoader` class provides an easy to use API to load mxrus files at runtime. The environment in the mxrus file can then be loaded and shown in your application as a Unity Scene. When shown, the scene gets instantiated in the Unity scene hierarchy which allows you to access and modify its GameObjects to further drive custom behaviour. 
  
For more information on loading an mxrus file at runtime inside your Unity app, see the "Advanced" section.
