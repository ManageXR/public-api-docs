# ManageXR React Streaming SDK

ManageXR has long offered remote device streaming: the ability to view what is happening on a device in real time. Whether you are showcasing a demo in the same room or troubleshooting a headset on the other side of the world, remote streaming has always made it easy.


The [ManageXR React Streaming SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@managexr/react-streaming#managexr-react-streaming-sdk) enables you to embed ManageXR-powered device streaming directly into any React web app.
