## Base URL

The ManageXR API provides a RESTful way to access your organization and device data. We enforce HTTPS.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://managexrapi.com
```

## Authentication
### Create an API Key
Go to Organization Settings > API Keys to generate a key

<Note>
Email developers@managexr.com for early access to a single API key that allows you to control multiple organizations
</Note>

### Authenticate Requests

To authenticate each request, add an Authorization header with the contents:

```
Authorization: Basic encoded-credentials
```
where `encoded-credentials` is the Base64 encoding of `api_key_id:api_key_secret`. 

If you're sending requests via curl or something like axios, you won't need to encode the id:secret pair.



## Quotas & Limits

API requests are subject to the following limits:
- 10 requests per second per organization

- 2.5 million requests per month per organization

 

You will be given direct feedback if you are over quota and your requests will fail. If you have requirements above this and would like to discuss expanding your quota, contact us at support@managexr.com.
