With ManageXR's 3D Environment SDK (mxrus-sdk), you can export a custom Unity scene to use as the immersive environment for your [custom VR home screen](https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5651012-home-screen-features-and-customizations). Building your own 3D environment gives you maximum control and customization over your end user experience. 

This package provides you the tools to export Unity scenes, required assets and relevant metadata into MXRUS (ManageXR Unity Scene) files with the `.mxrus` extension and to verify that your Unity scenes meet the compatibility requirments.

## Features
The ManageXR 3D Environment SDK (mxrus-sdk) allows you to build and export fully customized Unity scenes as immersive VR environments for your custom home screen.

By using this Unity Editor-based SDK, you can take full advantage of Unity's powerful scene-building tools while seamlessly exporting to the .mxrus format. Key benefits include:

* Familiar Unity workflow: Create immersive environments using tools and techniques already familiar to Unity developers.
* Support for a wide range of Unity features. Including but not limited to:
    * Baked and realtime lighting
    * Terrain tools
    * Particle systems
    * UI and TextMeshPro
    * Animation tools 
    * Custom shaders
    * Environment audio using AudioSource
    * Unity's profiling tools to optimize your environment
* Access to third-party assets through the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)

If you're building a custom launcher app using our [Device SDK](../sdk-reference/introduction), the SDK’s `SceneLoader` class offers a streamlined API that automatically extracts and loads `.mxrus` files at runtime. For more information on loading an `mxrus` file at runtime inside your Unity app, see the "Advanced" section.

## Alternatives

In addition to `.mxrus` files exported from Unity, ManageXR also supports the use of .glb and .gltf files for use as the VR Home Screen 3D environment. [Learn More](https://help.managexr.com/en/articles/5651012-home-screen-features-and-customizations#h_2ff18a07bf)
