## Overview
The [ManageXR Unity SDK (Beta)](https://github.com/ManageXR/mxr-unity-sdk/) enables developers to query device status information from the ManageXR Admin App running on your device, including:

- Device Serial Number
- Device Name, Configuration, Tags, etc.
- VR Content library details
- VR Content update download/install status

This SDK drives the ManageXR Home Screen, meaning you can use this to make your own custom home screen from the ground up!

**Usage Examples**

- Create your own Home Screen
- Update users in-headset when an update for you app is downloading/available
- Use device serial / details to augment your app's analytics reporting
- Launch wifi and other settings from within your app

## Feedback
<Note>
  This SDK is in beta. We want to hear from you! To suggest improvements or fixes, [open a Github Issue](https://github.com/ManageXR/mxr-unity-sdk/issues) or contact support@managexr.com for additional support.

## Not using Unity? 

The Unity SDK is the best way to communicate with the ManageXR Admin App. That said, if you are not using Unity to build your app, you can still query limited information from the ManageXR Admin App (the device serial number) using our Android SDK.

We've put together a sample project that demonstrates how to query the serial number on managed devices. This project is specifically for developers that need this functionality in native Android/Java code. Check it out here: https://github.com/ManageXR/mxr-android-sdk-serial-sample/tree/master
