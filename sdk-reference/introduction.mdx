## Overview
The [ManageXR Unity SDK (Beta)](https://github.com/ManageXR/mxr-unity-sdk/) enables developers to query device status information from the ManageXR Admin App running on your device, including:

- Device Serial Number
- Device Name, Configuration, Tags, etc.
- VR Content library details
- VR Content update download/install status

This SDK drives the ManageXR Home Screen, meaning you can use this to make your own custom home screen from the ground up!

**Usage Examples**

- Create your own Home Screen
- Update users in-headset when an update for you app is downloading/available
- Use device serial / details to augment your app's analytics reporting
- Launch wifi and other settings from within your app
